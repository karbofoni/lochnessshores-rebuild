## Why Choose the South Shore?

The South Shore of Loch Ness is generally quieter than the bustling North Shore (A82). This makes it perfect for families looking for a more relaxed pace.

### Top Campsites for Families

1. **South Shore Lochside Camping**
   - Direct access to the water (supervised)
   - Flat grassy pitches
   - No traffic noise

2. **Whitebridge Holiday Park**
   - Playground on site
   - Short walk to the Whitebridge Hotel for meals

### Family-Friendly Trails

- **Foyers Falls**: A short but spectacular walk to the waterfall. Beware of steep steps, but the main viewing platform is accessible.
- **Farigaig Forest**: Several marked trails with varying lengths and a loch viewpoint.

### Packing Tips for Kids

- **Midge Nets**: Essential for little ones.
- **Waterproofs**: Splash suits for toddlers are a lifesaver.
- **Tick Removers**: Always check for ticks after walking in long grass.
